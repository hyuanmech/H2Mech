# H2Mech
Chemical mechanism of hydrogen V1.0

The chemical mechanism for hydrogen was developed using the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Method on the GW4 ISAMBARD HPC. Comparisons with existing chemical mechanisms from XJTU [Sun et al., Combust. Flame, 2022] and BHU [Zhu et al., Combust. Flame, 2024] are presented in the table below.
